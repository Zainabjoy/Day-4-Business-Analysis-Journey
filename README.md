# Day 4 – Business Analysis Journey
This week, I explored advanced analytical concepts used in decision-making, focusing on trendline modeling and Net Present Value (NPV) analysis.

I learned to apply different types of trendlines in Excel — including linear, exponential, and power models — to understand data patterns and forecast outcomes. Each model helps interpret relationships between variables based on best-fit equations.

Additionally, I studied how to model Net Present Value (NPV) in Excel. I gained insight into the time value of money and how future cash flows can be discounted to determine if a project or investment is worthwhile. I used Excel’s =NPV() function, along with manual adjustments for initial cash outflows, to compute the actual net present value and assess project profitability.
